# ETO-Queue-Duration-Finder
This project searches through all of the ETO reports ever made in excel and finds how long each order stayed in the Christiansburg queue and how long it stayed in the headquarter's queue. The purpose of this is to collect data about processing ETO's to show HQ that the manufacturing plant in Christiansburg is processing ETO's faster then them.
